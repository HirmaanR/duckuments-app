# Duckuments-Core

### Overview

All sections related to uploading, receiving, sending to artificial intelligence, and creating output files are located in this section.

---

### **Sections**

1. **_Upload :_**

   1. Check and scan uploaded file
   2. Only files that meet file type and size restrictions are allowed to be uploaded.
   3. The user can add project and language related descriptions and send them along with the file.
   4. The file is sent using the API.

1. **_Extract :_**

   1. Extracts the sent file and saves it for later steps, the previous file is deleted to create better system performance.

1. **_AI :_**

   1. The contents of files within the project are read and sent to AI with a smart prompt.
   2. The results returned from the ai side are in the form of .md file contents. The returned intensity results are stored in files with the original file name.
   3. When the documentation is fully generated by AI, the extracted files are deleted.

1. **_Export :_**
   1. The content of the created documentation is returned using the API to create a live view for the user, also the user can download the created documentation.

## AI

### `gpt-4o`

This project utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o (gpt-4o), a cutting-edge multimodal model capable of understanding and generating human-like responses with high accuracy. GPT-4o is designed for optimized performance and faster inference, making it ideal for real-time and efficient documentation generation tasks.

Why GPT-4o?

High-quality natural language generation

Faster response times than GPT-4 or GPT-3.5

Better performance on complex prompts

Secure and privacy-focused via API integration

In this project, GPT-4o powers the core functionality of code analysis and documentation synthesis, converting raw code files into clean, human-readable Markdown documentation.
